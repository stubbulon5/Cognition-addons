/*
Change log:

    Major rewrite July 2016
    / Changed all objects into shared_ptr. Most functions should return copies, but be careful when passing chords around as they may share pointers to same notes unless first copied.
    + Added factory methods for Note, Chord, Scale (eg. NotePtr n = Note::create("Bb"))
    + Copy returns unique deep copies
    + Updated to C++11 and cleaned up a lot
    + Fixed plenty of bugs
    + Adapted octaves to Ableton midi register where C-3 = 60 (default before was C-4 = 48)
    + Added a range of chords and scales
    - Removed orphan code (eg. melody generator).
    - Removed rhythm & time classes. They were never particularly good.
